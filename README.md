This repo includes:

	* list of Python resources I found useful
	* my personal Python notes

This is by no means a full list of Python resources and will certainly be opinionated and miss some good ones. Please feel free to fork and submit pull requests. There is an entry level Python presentation I shared, you can found the video hereand the slides here.
Learning ResourcesNew programmersFor people who have never programmed, an online interactive course like code cademy (python 2) is highly recommended. Other online courses includes:

	* Google's Python Class
	* Python Wiki's Beginner Guide for non-programmers also includes a list of interactive courses and other useful resources
	* Runoob w3c-like Python Tutorial(Chinese) http://www.runoob.com/python/python-tutorial.html
